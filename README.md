Maristice is a clone of the old game Solistice featuring various Characters from the Touhou franchise. 
It was developed and released by @N-Factory in 2008.

This is a parser for aquiring the ressource files of Maristice. Like sound effects and background images.
These files are NOT available in this repository as doing so would violate copyright.
You need your own copy of Maristice to use this parser.

# Usage

1. Download and unzip release.zip from the release section
2. Drag data files unto the included exe, like sound.dat
3. Decryptet ressources will appear next to the dragged file (not next to the exe, unless in the same location).



### I love this game. Thank you so much @N-Factory.
